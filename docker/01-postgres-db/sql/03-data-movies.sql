5257	Excuse Me	1915	50	767303	R	Henry Mallory, U.S.A., receives orders to join his regiment which is to embark for the Philippines. The Overland Limited is the only train that will enable him to reach the coast in time to escape a court-martial. Having a little time to spare he persuades Marjorie to elope with him and reserves two berths. They reach the train in time, but haven't time to get married. "Little" Jimmy Wellington, who stands six feet two and weighs 350 in his stocking feet, guzzles too much, so his wife takes the Overland for Reno, telling him she goes to Paris for the year. He gets sore and takes the same train for the same place and for the same purpose. The Reverend Doctor Temple, tiring of the Monotony of Ypsilanti elopes and takes the Overland to the coast. There is another girl aboard, a former sweetheart of Mallory's. With this cargo in charge of a worthy porter, they start. The happenings en route are screamingly funny. Marjorie, not married to Mallory, has her reputation at stake. Dr. Temple knows this, but won't let anyone know that he's a preacher of the gospel. Wellington and his wife fail to meet because he's too busy pestering the men folks and she puffing cigars. Then the other girl pesters Marjorie and Mallory with a bracelet she received from Mallory, and so everyone does something that had been better left undone, and the porter must bear the brunt of it all. A hold-up relieves the girl of the bracelet and the arrival of the Mormon minister when they get to Utah frightens Temple into practicing his profession of the young couple. Then a cinder in Wellington's eye causes him to meet his wife who relieves him of it, and they patch up their differences. With everything running smoothly, we leave them to continue their journeys.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmVmMGE0ZTYtZWEwNC00ODFlLTg3YTQtNTA0ZGQ4MmY2YTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SY150_CR46,0,101,150_.jpg

8351	The Mysterious Mrs. Musslewhite	1917	50	916665	R	Raymond Van Seer, wealthy, has become morose and dissatisfied with life. His mental mood has worried his friends and when his true condition of mind is disclosed by the discovery that he is reading a book entitled "Famous Suicides," action becomes necessary. One of Van Seer's club friends has recently visited a fortune teller, known as "The Mysterious Mrs. M.," and relates his experiences to Van Seer. As a result of the combined urgings of his friends, Van Seer visits the sorceress. When she tells Van Seer that on a given date be will meet with a painful accident while out of doors, Van Seer hopes to thwart whatever truth there may be in her prognostication by remaining indoors, at his club, all day. Despite the invitations of his friends to venture forth, Van Seer sticks within his room until late in the afternoon, fire is discovered in the clubhouse and, with the other occupants, Van Seer rushes forth. Just as he is crossing the threshold, he trips, falls headlong to the sidewalk and breaks his wrist. He will have none of the attentions offered by the club physician, but takes his machine and rides to his country seat, where he submits his broken wrist to the treatment of Dr. Woodman, the family physician. Prompted by a desire to further test the abilities of the seeress, Van Seer again visits "The Mysterious Mrs. M." She informs him that on a certain date, still three months away, he is to die suddenly. As a token of his disbelief Van Seer gives her an order on his executor to pay her an immense sum of money if he shall die in accord with Mrs. Musselwhite's prophecy. The fortune teller hands him back the order, stating that his money will do her no good as she is herself going to die within a week. Van Seer bribes the fortune teller's butler to keep him advised of Mrs. Musselwhite's health. On the day the woman has set for her death, the butler calls Van Seer to the phone and informs him that Mrs. Musselwhite has died. Being now thoroughly convinced of the woman's ability Van Seer contemplates the likelihood of his own death as specified, but now he wants to live. Dr. Woodman's daughter, Phyllis, has come home from college. Van Seer has fallen in love with her, but believing that his day of death is fixed by fate he refrains from advancing his own cause while all the time Phyllis is in love with him. So matters continue until Van Seer's last day on earth. He spends the hours alone, locked in his library, watching the hands of the clock approach the hour of midnight. When at last the hour of midnight arrives and passes with Van Seer still alive he is suddenly aroused to the realities of life by having his club friends burst in upon him with a letter from "The Mysterious Mrs. M." She has, all along, acted in the employ of Van Seer's club friends and has prognosticated and acted along previously decided lines. Rejoicing in his good health, good fortune and the love of Phyllis, there is the happy ending of Van Seer's romance of life and death.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0NjAxMTIzMzheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQ2NDYyNTQx._V1_SY150_CR2,0,101,150_.jpg

He swims to shore and is taken in by Hazleton (Walter Wills), a former engraver at the mint convicted for counterfeiting. Hazleton shows Talbot a forged land grant he has created. An interested Talbot is drawn into Hazleton's plans to lay claim to 3,000,000 acres, and he assumes the identity of Don Luis de Serrano.The forgery is upheld in court and posing as a benevolent land baron, the greedy Don soon extracts heavy taxes from the real landowners. He also, with the aid of his many henchmen, takes livestock, possessions and property . Even the Three- M ranch is not immune and while the Mesquiteers repulse the Don's collectors, but are forced by their friend sheriff Pratt (Kermit Mayanard) to move off the land. They join the other dispossessed ranchers and write to President Garfield and even he is forced to acknowledge the Don's claim. Stony stirs his partners into action by reminding them that the ones who opened up this country didn't sit around and cry for help...they took action. Clad in white, the Mesquiteers become Los Capaqueros,, mysterious caped riders taking up the cause of ranchers. Like Robin Hood, they steal from the collectors and return the goods and money to the poor. THe enraged Don Luis sends his henchmen out to hunt down the caped-robbers, who, escaping one of the Don's traps, climb into the bedroom of a surprised President Garfield (Francis Sayles), who is touring the west and anxious to relieve the tense situation. He tells them he needs hard evidence that the Don is not who he claims to be. Stony finds the proof but not before the president is assassinated and they are captured and facing a firing squad.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI5Zjg5NGQtMmIxYy00ZTkzLWIxOTYtNzVhYmU3M2RmNTRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDcxNDkxMjA@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

39694	The Paradine Case	1947	125	33	R	Following a short investigation, the London Police charge Maddalena Paradine with the poisoning murder of her older, blind husband, retired Colonel Richard Paradine, who was dependent on her and others to manage in his life due to his physical disability. She is up front about being a woman with a past, she only becoming wealthy and thus glamorous because of the marriage. Her personal solicitor Sir Simon Flaquer refers the case to his colleague Tony Keane. In spending time with Mrs. Paradise in prison, Tony is immediately attracted to her, that attraction which morphs into obsession. As such, Tony does whatever he can to clear her of the charges, either in mounting a defense of suicide, assisted or not, or that someone else killed him, the most likely candidate being the Colonel's trusted valet, Andre Latour, with who Tony initially believes Mrs. Paradise was having an affair. In the process, Tony may be blinded to the evidence as it presents itself. Who can see what is going on is Tony's wife Gay Keane, who not only believes their marriage has been a perfect one up to this point, but that he truly does believe his obsession with Mrs. Paradine being love, which Gay herself does not believe it to be. Gay can only stand by and hope for a specific verdict in the case so that Tony can return to her wholeheartedly without the specter of Mrs. Paradine hanging over their marriage.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFlY2ZhNzQtZmY0MC00Y2IwLTg1MTEtZDFhMjgyNmQ1NjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

Charles arrives to tell her that all arrangements are made for her to leave with him and the company for Burma, but she refuses saying she will never marry an actor. Barmaid Kate tells Charles why Carole feels the way she does about actors: Carole's mother, Lillian Grey, was with a touring show in 1913 when the handsome star, John Beaumont raised her from the chorus to be his partner in his first West End show. They were a success, fell in love and were married. But the war soon took Beau off to Flanders and Lillian was left to become a great star on her own. Carole was born in wartime, but saw little of her busy mother.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NDQ5NzI4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU4NTk5Mw@@._V1_SY150_CR2,0,101,150_.jpg

While Captain Wiles is in the adjacent forest, he sees other people stumble across Harry, most of whom don't seem to know him or care or notice that he's dead. One person who does see Captain Wiles there is spinster Ivy Gravely, who vows to keep the Captain's secret about Harry.

Over the course of the day, several revelations come to light that question if Captain Wiles actually killed Harry. Sam, Mrs. Rogers, Captain Wiles and Miss Gravely's individual and collective actions in the matter of Harry take into account friendship, self-preservation, the path of least resistance, love and a lot of realizations about what their past actions will mean. Their work may all be for naught if Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs, the closest thing to law enforcement in their town, finds out about Harry.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjlkYmE2YzYtYzIzMC00ODFhLTljNjYtZjA4YWY2ZGM5NTYwL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

The first is wealthy and elegant platinum blonde Madeleine Elster, the wife of his college acquaintance Gavin Elster, who hires John to follow her in Gavin's belief that she may be a danger to herself in thinking that she has recently been possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes, Madeleine's great-grandmother who she knows nothing about, but who Gavin knows committed suicide in being mentally unbalanced when she was twenty-six, Madeleine's current age. The second is Judy Barton, who John spots on the street one day. Judy is a working class girl, but what makes John obsessed with her is that, despite her working class style and her brunette hair, she is the spitting image of Madeleine, into who he tries to transform Judy. The initial question that John has is if there is some connection between Madeleine and Judy. What happens between John and individually with Madeleine and Judy is affected by the reason John took that early retirement: a recent workplace incident that showed that he is acrophobic which leads to a severe case of vertigo whenever he looks down from tall heights.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTE4ODEwZDUtNDFjOC00NjAxLWEzYTQtYTI1NGVmZmFlNjdiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

During their long horseback voyage from Texas to Virginia, the seven young men will witness first-hand the Southern prejudice and snobbery. They also will witness the lynching of runaway black slaves. Filled with dreams of war glory, they will nevertheless push ahead toward their destination. Their trek eastward is eventful and fraught with dangers, as the Texans will occasionally get into trouble with the townsfolk from various towns. Although they do eventually join the Confederate forces, it will happen in Shiloh, Tennessee not in Richmond, Virginia as planned. After becoming soldiers, they realize that war is not what they expected or dreamed about. The army and the war are not at all compatible with the core human values of ordinary Texans.

Alistair and Cecil are Charlie's groomsmen; despite neither really believing in marriage, they believe in love and friendship and will do everything they can to make Charlie's married life tolerable (they think it will be miserable). Charlie, Alistair, and Cecil arrive on the island the morning of the day before the ceremony, the first time they will actually be meeting for the first time most of Josephine's very large network of family, extended family, friends, and acquaintances, many of whom border on the eccentric. As Charlie goes through the process of the pre-wedding events, including the stag party, rehearsal, rehearsal dinner, and the minister's counseling services, some problems arrive, like the Fishes' trusty servant Baker expressing frustration about his job, Charlie starts to have doubts about marrying Josephine and tries to work his way out of the wedding. If that doesn't work, his Plan B is to sabotage the wedding. This film is less a "will he or won't he make it to the church on time?"; rather, it's a satire on the rituals associated with weddings; excerpts from the fictional etiquette book "The Compleat Bridegroom" are presented as title cards to these events, followed by the mess of the actual event.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU3YjNlNGQtZjUyYi00ZmZhLTgzNjAtMDExODEyN2YxNWY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

65775	Getting Straight	1970	124	750701	R	Harry Bailey is two weeks away from getting his Masters degree in Education at a liberally-minded university, after his undergraduate degree in English and English literature, his goal to get a teaching certificate to teach high school English. This goal is a far cry from his renowned student activist days when he was in his undergraduate, his intermediate stint in Vietnam which has given him a view of a more stable future as a real adult. But getting his degree is not a guarantee as he tries to juggle the many facets of his life, including getting enough money not only to pay his tuition, but pay his rent, buy food and keep his broken down car running. Those many priorities lead to him often taking what he considers the most expedient route to reach his end goals, which often means getting friends and colleagues to do work for him, including taking tests, despite he having the academic smarts to pass any of his tests easily if he applied himself. But the conflict in his life that may factor into what he does in these two weeks is that goal of a relatively conservative teaching future, albeit in doing what he thinks is a lofty goal of shaping impressionable young minds, versus the pull by his activist friends on campus to go back into activism as they prepare for one protest after another, many related to student rights. This conflict is highlighted in his relationship with fellow student Jan. While the two seem to love each other, their outward goals for their future, both individually and as a potential couple, may be incompatible.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc3ZWU0ZjQtMTQ2MC00OTJhLTkzN2EtYTMyYTNjZGVhM2EwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

70948	Zardoz	1974	105	958	R	2293. Zardoz, an unseen "God" who speaks through an idol, a large stone statue of a head, leads a barbaric race called the Brutals, who live a harsh existence in the Outlands. Zardoz tells the Brutals that once they die, they will be transported to the Vortex, where they will live happily as immortals. He has armed a small group, the Exterminators, with guns, as Zardoz's philosophy is that killing is good, and procreation is the root of all that is bad. In reality, Zardoz is Arthur Frayn, from a competing, more advanced race, called "the Eternals", who live in paradise in the Vortex. The Eternals truly are immortal as they do not age and their bodies undergo reconstruction if they "die". As such, they truly do not believe in procreation as their society has reached perfect equilibrium. Past human acts such as sex and sleep are obsolete in their advanced state. All major decisions are achieved through pure democracy. The Eternals, however, are not immune to non life threatening disease or sin, the latter which is punishable by aging, only making their life less pleasant, but not ever killing them. Arthur's mission as Zardoz is to control, monitor, and study the Brutals for the Eternals. Being in the Outlands, Arthur is isolated without communication back to the Vortex and the Eternals. In his work as an Exterminator, Zed, by accident, is able to find his way to the Vortex as a still alive being. The Eternals vote to keep Zed alive temporarily so that they can study him before they kill him. Amongst the Eternals who have direct interactions with Zed are: May, the lead scientist, who believes Zed is a blessing in that they have not had access to a Brutal in some time; Friend, a hedonist who wants to use Zed as the animal he considers him to be; and Consuela, the hard lined one who believes in vigilante justice. In the Eternals' access to Zed, they may learn if he making it to the Vortex was indeed an accident. In addition, their so-called Utopian society may be exposed for what it truly is.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5NTYzNzMtNzhmOS00NzEyLWJlMWMtMzUzNjdhYjY2NDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwMzI2NzU@._V1_SY150_CR1,0,101,150_.jpg
71115	Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore	1974	112	217	R	Despite admitting that she was scared of him in her never-ending quest to please him, thirty-five year old housewife and mother Alice Hyatt is devastated when her husband Donald is killed in an on the job traffic accident. With few job skills except that as a singer, Alice, along with her precocious eleven year old son Tommy, decides to move from their current home in Socorro, New Mexico to her home town of Monterrey, California, the only place she has ever felt happy. She plans on getting singing gigs along the way to earn money to get back to Monterrey by the end of the summer and the start of Tommy's school year. Alice's quest for a job at each stop leaves Tommy often to fend for himself, which may make Tommy even more precocious. His behavior is fostered by Alice, as their relationship is often more as trouble-making friends than mother and son. Alice's plans often do not end up as she envisions, especially as she is forced to take a waitressing job at Mel and Ruby's Diner in Tucson, Arizona, which entails working with a disparate group, including Mel, the establishment's gruff owner/short order cook, and her fellow waitresses, the wisecracking, foul mouthed Flo, and the naive and shy Vera. Alice also falls into old habits, namely relying on men to make her feel fulfilled, specifically the much younger Ben, and farmer David. Those relationships may also provide her with a better perspective on her life and her bad choice of Donald as a husband.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NzYzNDI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyNTY1Mw@@._V1_SY150_CR1,0,101,150_.jpg

71877	Murder on the Orient Express	1974	128	1486	R	The first class compartment of the December 1935 departure of the Orient Express from Istanbul is full, unusual for this time of the year. Regardless, famed and fastidious Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who needs to get back to London immediately, is able to secure last minute passage in the compartment with the assistance of his friend, Signor Bianchi, one of the directors of the train line who is also making the trip. Some of the first class passengers seem concerned about Poirot's presence on the train. At least one of them has reason to be concerned, as later, another first class passenger, who earlier in the trip asked Poirot to provide protection for him due to several death threats, is found murdered in his stateroom by multiple stabbings. At the time the victim is found, the train is unexpectedly stopped and delayed due to snow in remote Yugoslavia, which may be problematic for the murderer in getting away now that Poirot is on the case, which he is doing as a favor to Bianchi as not to get the Yugoslav police involved. Poirot quickly learns that the victim was not who he presented himself to be and has a connection to a five-year-old American kidnapping and murder case of infant Daisy Armstrong, murdered in spite of the fact that her parents had paid the requested ransom. The murderer in that case has long been convicted and executed but the ransom moneys were never recovered, a known accomplice never captured, and both the Armstrong parents have since tragically died. As Poirot questions the train's valet, the victim's accompanying staff, and the other primarily well off first class passengers and their accompanying servants, who are all on the surface more than cooperative, he finds that many had opportunity and motive, the latter which may not be obvious. There is also a great deal of evidence discovered on the train, which pulls his thoughts in many directions. These pieces of information may complicate the deduction of who is the murderer.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDlkZjJjYTktZDI4OS00MWFkLTg1MzMtNTY3MmI2OTBkMTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

Her mother, Margaret White, is a religious fanatic, her extreme views primarily targeted against sex, which she believes is a sin. She even believes natural associated processes such as menstruation are a sin, about which she has refused to mention to Carrie. Mrs. White's beliefs were taken to that extreme largely because of her own failed marriage and her husband Ralph long ago having run off with another woman. The only adult authority figure who tries to help Carrie with her life is her phys ed teacher, Miss Collins, who is nonetheless warned not to get too close to go against how Mrs. White chooses to raise Carrie, Mrs. White whose beliefs are well known in the community. An impromptu event that happens among Carrie's phys ed classmates against her leads to her classmates being punished. One of those students, self absorbed Chris Hargensen, vows revenge against Carrie for that punishment, the method of the revenge associated to the phys ed class incident. Another student however, the popular Sue Snell, begins to feel sorry for Carrie. In wanting to help her get out of her shell, Sue asks her boyfriend, the equally popular Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the senior prom instead of her. This move does not sit well with Mrs. White, who in her extreme view believes Carrie will fall prey to sin. All these competing issues lead to Carrie deciding on an impulse to use a newfound skill to free herself from the figurative chains that have long been placed around her, with tragic consequences.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlhNmVkZGUtNjdjOC00YWY3LTljZWQtMTY1YWFhNGYwNDQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

75784	A Bridge Too Far	1977	175	277	R	The true story of Operation Market Garden, the Allies attempt, in September 1944, to hasten the end of World War II by driving through Belgium and Holland into Germany. The idea was for U.S. airborne divisions to take the towns of Eindhoven and Nijmegen and a British airborne division, reinforced by a Polish airborne brigade, to take the town of Arnhem. They would be reinforced, in due course and in turn, by the British XXX Corps, land-based and driving up from the British lines in the south. The key to the operation was the bridges, as if the Germans held or blew them, the paratroopers could not be relieved. Faulty intelligence, Allied high command hubris, and stubborn German resistance would ensure that Arnhem was a bridge too far.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWRjZmZmYmItYzczOS00NjY4LTk3ODItNGU3ZDQ2ZGJkYmZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg
75860	Close Encounters of the Third Kind	1977	138	229	R	Two parallel stories are told. In the first, a group of research scientists from a variety of backgrounds are investigating the strange appearance of items in remote locations, primarily desert regions. In continuing their investigation, one of the lead scientists, a Frenchman named Claude Lacombe, incorporates the Kod√°ly method of music education as a means of communication in their work. The response, in turn, at first baffles the researchers, until American cartographer David Laughlin deciphers the meaning of the response. In the second, electric company lineman and family man Roy Neary and single mother Jillian Guiler are among some individuals in Muncie, Indiana who experience some paranormal activity before some flashes of bright lights in the sky, which they believe to be a UFO. Roy becomes obsessed with what he saw, unlike some others, especially in some form of authority, who refuse to acknowledge their belief that it was a UFO in not wanting to appear crazy. That obsession both for Roy and Jillian is ratcheted up a notch when they begin to have a vision of a mound with vertical striations on its side as a key to what is going on. While the obsession negatively affects Roy's life as he knows it in its entirety, Jillian knows she has to find the answer as to its meaning, especially as it relates to her only child, three year old Barry Guiler, who may be more attuned to what is happening than the adult figures around him. These two stories have the potential to intersect if Roy and Jillian can discover where they've seen that mound before, and if they can overcome what they believe to be the lies perpetrated by those in authority in covering up what is going on.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NjE5NjQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYzMzQxMDE@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

75993	An Enemy of the People	1978	103	769615	R	It's winter in a small southern Norwegian town in the late nineteenth century. After years of struggling, Dr. Thomas Stockmann and his family - his wife Catherine, their young adult daughter Petra, and their two adolescent sons Ejlif and Morten - have returned to town after being away for five years up north, he now well respected and successful as the medical resident of the Health Institute at Kirsten Springs, where he is also a board member. He devised the springs and institute as a center of therapeutic benefits on his own, but developed it with his brother, the town mayor, Peter Stockmann, who is the board chair. They have reinvigorated what was the financially crumbling town. Peter takes credit for giving Thomas this air of respectability, something that has never been important to Thomas, who would rather be seen as a man of conviction in doing the right thing. In this respect, Petra takes after her father. Thomas often writes articles for the local activist newspaper, The People's Daily Messenger, as part of doing the right thing. The Messenger's editor, Hovstad, who is attracted to Petra, sees the mayor as part of a group of townsfolk in positions of power solely for their own benefit - an old boys' club. Thomas' latest article, not yet published and what he wanted to investigate during the springs' off season before tourists start arriving in the spring, concerns the water supply at Kirsten Springs. As he feared, in the board's decision to locate the institute's water supply in the cheapest site and in the process dismissing Thomas' original recommendations, the water is being polluted, contaminated by being located downstream from a tannery. Through the story, Thomas wants to protect the overall public health, and does not want to be seen as a hero or extraordinary in doing so. When Peter finds out about the article, he does whatever he can to quash the story, including fear mongering, intimidation and using the power of being both the mayor and the board chair. His primary concern is increasing the viability of the institute by increasing the number of visitors, while doing as little as possible to increase costs, fixing the water problem, which he is not convinced even exists, being cost prohibitive. Although not his direct motivation, Peter is not averse to ruining Thomas' reputation in the process, making Thomas an enemy of the public which would make it easier to protect his own interests even more.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjcxY2JlMTMtYjJkMy00YWUzLWI1NDctZjdhNzY2ZWNmZjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

After Victor holds his own against wrestler Frankie the Thumper in an arm wrestling match, Frankie who is seen as the strongest man in the neighborhood, and after seeing the lucrative wrestling matches - which are more like street fights without rules - at the underground nightclub called Paradise Alley, Cosmo gets it into his head that wrestling may be Victor's calling and a way for them all to get out of Hell's Kitchen for good. The brothers would act as trainer and manager. Lenny, doing it only to ensure Victor's safety, and Victor, who is rechristened "Kid Salami", ultimately agree. But instead of bonding the brothers closer together, the wrestling life and their relationship to a taxi dancer named Annie threatens to tear them apart as their priorities start to diverge.

Police units, called "blade runners", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance "retiring" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQzMzJhZTEtOWM4NS00MTdhLTg0YjgtMjM4MDRkZjUwZDBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

His current rank is Gunnery Sergeant. His experiences have led him to become an opinionated, no nonsense man, who is prone to bursts of violence, especially when he's drunk, if the situation does not suit him, regardless of the specifics or people involved. Because of these actions, he has spent his fair share of overnighters behind bars. Close to retirement, one of his last assignments, one he requested, is back at his old unit at Cherry Point, North Carolina, from where he was transferred for insubordination and conduct unbecoming. He is to train a reconnaissance platoon. His superior officer, the much younger and combat inexperienced Major Malcolm Powers (Everett McGill), sees Highway as a relic of an old-styled military. Highway's commanding officer, Lieutenant Ring (Boyd Gaines), the platoon leader, is also a younger man who has no combat experience, but is academically inclined and happy-go-lucky. Highway finds that his team is a rag-tag bunch of slackers, who includes wannabe rock musician Corporal Stitch Jones (Mario Van Peebles), with whom Highway had an inauspicious earlier meeting. The men in the platoon, who truly believe Highway is crazy, hate him, and don't understand why they have to follow his harsh training regimen when the United States is not currently at war. The Major, who is all about efficiency regardless of combat readiness, has the same views of Highway. He is clear that he sees Highway's platoon solely as a training mechanism for his own elite squad trained by Highway's nemesis, Staff Sergeant Webster (Moses Gunn). Things for Highway and his platoon change when the United States enters into war in Grenada. Through it all, Highway tries to reconnect with his bar waitress ex-wife Aggie (Marsha Mason), he even clandestinely reading women's magazines to understand her better. Two primary obstacles stand in his way: Roy Jennings (Bo Svenson), Aggie's boss and current suitor who hates Marines, and Aggie's own remembrance of how dysfunctional their marriage was.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWNiOTY4ZGUtYzM2Ny00ZTE2LThjZmEtNjI2MzA5NDRmNTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

99077	Awakenings	1990	121	1508	R	1969. Dr. Malcolm Sayer is hired as a clinical physician at a local hospital in the Bronx, despite only having a research background. The job is not ideal on his side as he has difficulties relating to people which is the reason he has focused on research projects not involving human subjects, while the hospital hires him somewhat out of desperation in not finding anyone else with the qualifications who wants the job. Most of his patients are in a semi-catatonic state and are housed in what some of the orderlies coin the "garden" ward, where all they can do for the patients is water and feed them. He notices that some of the patients, despite their generally catatonic state, respond in unusual ways to certain stimuli. In doing some research, he also finds that some common bonds between these patients are that they suffered from encephalitis in the 1920s or 1930s, and that their physical states are like they have Parkinson's disease frozen in time. As such, he is able to convince, albeit reluctantly, his skeptical boss, Dr. Kaufman, to administer an expensive experimental drug therapy on only one patient with family consent. That patient is forty-one year old Leonard Lowe, who has been in his current state since he was eleven years old, and who has been supported by his loving mother through all these years. As the drug therapy "awakens" Leonard, there are several issues that come into play. Malcolm has to try and convince Kaufman and the hospital administration to extend the therapy to the other patients. Despite not knowing the long term effects, Leonard, who was aware of his surroundings through his catatonic state, may have mixed emotions about his situation, wanting both to be treated as human being and an experiment guinea pig to ensure that what is happening benefits him and others in the long run. Mrs. Lowe may be unprepared for the new Leonard, she expecting who she remembers as a sweet eleven year old boy. Through all these issues, what may be the most illuminating issue for Malcolm is the need to stimulate the human spirit, including his own in dealing with people around him.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUxOTk2NzUtZDBjYi00MzIwLWFlODYtZjFmNDM5MjlkYjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

His wife, Barbara Sabich, has been struggling with focus on completing her Ph.D. dissertation in Mathemetics - a thus far ten year process - she who nonetheless is applying for a college teaching position. They are generally in a loving, supportive marriage, Barbara who seems to have gotten over Rusty's infidelity with his colleague Carolyn Polhemus, an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney. Carolyn is ambitious, she who, in part, used Rusty to try and climb up the ladder. Barbara will still throw the issue of Carolyn in his face whenever there are problems between the two. Rusty and Carolyn's affair is unknown to others in their personal and professional circles. Rusty is handed the most personal case of his career when his boss and mentor, Chief Prosecuting Attorney Raymond Horgan, assigns him the case to discover who killed Carolyn, her dead body found in her apartment in what looks initially to be a violent rape, with Carolyn eventually strangled and no sign of forced entry, leading to the belief her killer was whoever her lover or possibly someone she prosecuted. Raymond, who is in a difficult reelection campaign, wants a quick resolution to the investigation, as "finding the killer" will greatly increase his chances of getting reelected. Rusty tries to dissuade Raymond from giving him the case because of the affair of which Raymond is unaware, with Rusty eventually having no choice but to accept barring disclosure of the affair. As Rusty proceeds with the investigation, he takes steps to hide the affair largely to protect Barbara and their adolescent son, Nat Sabich. Those measures come back to bite him when they and other evidence collected by the police lead to him being charged for Carolyn's murder. Rusty hires Sandy Stern, one of his toughest adversaries in a number of previous cases. During the court proceedings, many involved do whatever they can protect their own interest regardless of the truth. Beyond Rusty being convicted or acquitted, a question thus becomes if the truth matters or if the murderer will ever be discovered.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODU4NjQwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkwNTg4NjE@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

Despite often fighting, they truly do love each other. That love is why Sarah would rather Zora attend Berkeley for her freshman year than science prodigy Zora's first choice of M.I.T. on the other side of the country. Caught in a lie, Sarah is forced to admit to Zora that her husband Charlie, who died before Zora was born and who was the love of her life, is not Zora's biological father as Zora has always believed, but that she was conceived via artificial insemination using anonymous sperm from a sperm bank. Determined to have a man in her life she can truly call a "Dad" all her own, Zora, with the help of her longtime best friend Tea Cake Walton, is able to break into the sperm bank's computerized records to find the donor's information, including his name: Hal Jackson. Zora is horrified to learn several things about Hal: that he is *the* Hal Jackson, a local car salesman well known for using tacky methods of advertising; that he is boorish and loutish, stereotypical of his business; but arguably most importantly, that he is Caucasian as in white, white, white, and not even a little black. Both Sarah and Hal, when told Zora's discovery, are taken aback, Sarah in particular incensed that such an error could have been made in having requested a black donor if Zora is indeed a product of Hal's sperm. With the proverbial cat out of the bag, all three have to decide what to do with the information including if Hal should be a part of Zora and thus by association Sarah's life. The information does make Hal at least examine his life, including two so far failed marriages, and now living with a vacuous and stereotypical blonde named Stacy. And despite who Hal is, Sarah and Zora may see him ultimately in a different light than they intended and in a light different than what they would have wanted for the other.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjhmYzdlMmQtOWVlOC00NDI0LWFiN2YtMGE0ZTc1ZDJhOGMzL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

113071	First Knight	1995	134	958387	R	After King Arthur of Camelot has fought several wars which has led to peace and justice for his land, he is turning his attention to thoughts of marriage, his chosen one being Lady Guinevere, who has become head of neighboring Leonesse following the death of her father. Peace and justice for Arthur and Guinevere are short lived as Prince Malagant, one of the knights of the round table, wants Camelot for himself and King Arthur deposed. Many in the land follow Malagant, whose quest also involves marauding Leonesse. As the King's betrothed, Guinevere becomes Malagant's target in achieving both of his goals. Meanwhile, Lancelot is a free-living peasant who often makes his way through life by demonstrations of his sword fighting prowess. His skill is largely due to his ability to assess his opponents, and not fear dying. On Malagant's first attempt at abducting Guinevere, Lancelot, by happenstance, is there to save her. He falls in love with her at first sight. Although attracted to the man who saved her, Guinevere cannot think of any other man in the lead up to her marriage to Arthur. Because of his attraction to Guinevere, Lancelot becomes involved in the battles between Malagant and Arthur in Lancelot doing whatever needed to keep Guinevere safe. As these battles brew and as Arthur becomes indebted to Lancelot for saving Guinevere at the possible expense of his own life, Guinevere cannot help but fall for Lancelot, resulting in a romantic triangle comprised of Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, a triangle of which Arthur is unaware.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ1MDU2ZWUtMmYzOS00ZWExLTk4M2QtNzE5MTFkZTNmZTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

162222	Cast Away	2000	143	709	R	Memphis-based FedEx operations executive Chuck Noland and grad student Kelly Frears have long dated and lived together, and despite each being the love of the other's life, have not gotten married because of their respective busy schedules, especially Chuck's as he is more often on business trips than he is at home. That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Y5ZTU4YjctMDRmMC00MTg4LWE1M2MtMjk4MzVmOTE4YjkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTc1NTQxODI@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama.

Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian's father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias, and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim leader Saladin Ayubi. But Baldwin's days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin's vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth.

Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university.

In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks' adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend "Jessica", really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the Parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves. The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the Parks.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZjMjk3ZTItODQ2ZC00NTY5LWE0ZDYtZTI3MjcwN2Q5NTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk4OTc3MTY@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

7959026	The Mule	2018	116	142	R	Clint Eastwood stars as Earl Stone, a man who is ninety years old, broke, alone, and facing foreclosure of his business when he is offered a job that simply requires him to drive. Easy enough, but, unbeknownst to Earl, he's just signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel. He does well, so well, in fact, that his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler. But he isn't the only one keeping tabs on Earl. The mysterious new drug mule has also hit the radar of hard-charging D.E.A. Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper). And even as his money problems become a thing of the past, Earl's past mistakes start to weigh heavily on him, and it's uncertain if he'll have time to right those wrongs before law enforcement, or the cartel's enforcers, catch up to him.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTc5NzA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAzMzE2NjM@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg

Realizing this improbable opportunity, Jack begins playing the music of one of the world's greatest rock bands, being forced to claim it as his own. It pays off quickly and Jack becomes a worldwide musical sensation. However, Jack finds himself drifting away from Ellie, only realizing his love for her when she has become intimidated by his success, which depends on a blatant plagiarization that no one could find out. Now, Jack must make a fundamental moral decision about his music to satisfy his conscience as he decides what he truly needs.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0NTI0NjkyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY0MTE0NzM@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg
